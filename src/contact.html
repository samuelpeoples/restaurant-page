								<span class="member-info">Founder & Chief Executive Officer (CEO)</span>

								<p class="member-text">
									A former miner turned culinary visionary, Thrain Ironbelly founded Bear Klaw after
									perfecting his grandmother’s legendary stone stew recipe in a lava-vent kitchen.
									Known for his booming voice and bigger heart, Thrain believes food should be as bold
									as a warhammer and as comforting as a warm hearth. His leadership style is
									old-school: loyalty, honesty, and lots of mead-fueled meetings.

								<span class="member-info">Chief Culinary Officer (CCO)</span>

								<p class="member-text">
									Bera is a culinary prodigy whose spice rack is the stuff of legend. Raised in the
									Emberforge Mountains, she apprenticed under flame druids before joining Bear Klaw to
									revamp its menu. Her signature "Smoked Basilisk Ribs" turned the restaurant from a
									tavern curiosity into a dwarven dining empire. Don’t challenge her on mushroom
									pairings—you’ll lose.

								<span class="member-info">Chief Financial Officer (CFO)</span>

								<p class="member-text">
									Once a gem trader, Durik saw more profit in roasted cave boar than raw diamonds.
									He’s the numbers dwarf behind Bear Klaw’s massive expansion. Calculating but fair,
									Durik always wears a gold-inlaid abacus ring and can recite profit margins faster
									than you can say “ale turnover.” His motto? “If it doesn’t clink, rethink.”

								<span class="member-info">Head of Marketing & Public Relations</span>

								<p class="member-text">
									Frunda used to sing battle songs in the Deephall Choirs, but now she chants slogans
									that keep Bear Klaw in every dwarf’s mouth. She’s behind the iconic catchphrase:
									“Grub so good, you’ll grow a second beard!” Frunda is fiercely passionate about
									brand loyalty and occasionally hosts eating contests while reciting dwarven epics.

									class="member-img" />

								<span class="member-info">Chief Operations Officer (COO)</span>

								<p class="member-text">
									A logistics genius who once organized the evacuation of a collapsing salt mine and
									catered it, Grumbek runs day-to-day ops like a well-oiled crossbow. From supply
									chains that span three mountain ranges to ensuring every Bear Klaw location has the
									exact right oven temperature, he’s the backbone of the business. Just don’t move his
									tools.
